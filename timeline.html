                <p>Neuro-sama was temporarily banned from Twitch

                    According to one of the channel's moderators, the 
                    account was banned for hateful speech, though the 
                    exact reason was unknown. It was speculated to 
                    be related to clips circulating where commenters had 
                    tricked Neuro into making controversial statements, such

                <p>Vedal launched a Chinese Bilibili account called "Vedal and

                    has an additional content filter. Unlike the Twitch channels, 
                    which use the chat overlay from the main vedal987 channel, the 
                    Bilibili stream displays its native chat.</p>

                <p>Neuro had a collab with DougDoug, consisting of a GeoGuessr 
                    duel between human and AI duos: Neuro and Vedal, against 
                    DougDoug and his Twitch Chat AI that can read his chat. 
                    The winner would get a trophy that says "World's Smartest 
                    Artificial Intelligence at GeoGuessr" (later doubled to two 
                    of the same trophy as part of a double-or-nothing challenge

                    better AI on stream and (proposed by Neuro) send 100 gifted 
                    subs to the winner. Neurosama won.</p>
